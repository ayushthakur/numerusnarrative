Well, at one point of time we didn't. We have presented worse things to our clients and were 'educated' by them rightfully.
This blog is our effort at writing down those lessons so that you don't make a complete fool out of yourself and end up pulling an all-nighter.
Or if you are someone from the other side of the table, then hopefully you don't get fooled by a *data enthusiast*
